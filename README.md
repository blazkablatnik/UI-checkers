## Checkers implementation

Implementation of checkers is in file `checkers.py`, and follows the international checkers ruleset (10 x 10 grid, backward jumps, longest jump chains, flying kings...)

A very nice website explaining international checkers rules is [this itsyourturn.com section](https://itsyourturn.com/t_helptopic2130.html).

Implementation requires **Python 3.5+**
