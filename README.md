## Checkers implementation

Implementation of checkers is in file `checkers.py`, and follows the international checkers ruleset (10 x 10 grid, backward jumps, longest jump chains, flying kings...)

How international checkers rules differs from standard checkers' ones can be found [on this website](http://www.boardgamecentral.com/rules/checkers-rules-international.html), as well as standard checkers rules.

Implementation requires **Python 3.5+**
